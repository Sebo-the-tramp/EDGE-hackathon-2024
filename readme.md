## EDGE Hackathon 2024

This repository contains the main code relative to the hackathon

The structure is so divided:

- `simulation/` contains the code to produce the simulation
- `website/` website with the results of the simulation
- `solution/` contains the code to solve the problem and produce the file to submit


### Solution 

To run the solution, open the main file HackathonCodes.ipynb and run the cells in order. The solution will be saved in the same folder.


### Simulation

To run the simulation, open the main file sol.ipynb and run the cells in order. The images of the simulations will be saved in the /image folder.

### Website

To run the website, first, you need to copy all the created images from the simulation to the /website/assets/images folder. Then, run the command

```bash
python app.py
```
